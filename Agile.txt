What is Agile?
Agile is an approach to managing and working with project
-It relates to managing and working with projects 

-In other words - project management and product development 

-Agile is simple approach to managing complexity
-Agile approach can be applied to any tpye of project 
-Most modern software projects use Agile methodology

other uses:
-Agile also used for managing service tickets
>related to software issues or restaurant orders

-In a company Agile can be used in any department:
-for example: HR department can manage the flow of hiring new employees
-another ex: Marketing team might use for new marketing initiative.

-Agile can be used for personally too:
>for writing a book: Agile technique will help you to focus and write better book
>If you want to build a rocket you can use Agile (SpaceX uses Agile to continously improve the product)
--------------------------
CHARACTERISTICS OF AGILE PROJECTS:
-Each project is unique, but have common characteristics
    >Incremental 
    >iterative
    >Focus on value
    >An empowered team



>Incremental:
-Agile products are built incrementally
-this means that instead of planning, building and releasing the product all at once, 
small valuable increment of the product are planned and released in a succession.

-An increment may actually go to the customer or the increment may be
releasable subject to a business decision.

-either way, each increment should be usable and valuable to teh customer.

>Iterative:
-Agile products are iterative.
-This means that you continously obtain feedback
from both users and from inside the team allowing
continous improvement.

>Focus on Value:
-Agile projects relentlessly focus on value.
-After current work, the team again decides what is the 
next highest value thing to work on.
-This is based on continous feedback from the team and from users of the product.

>An empowered team:
-Agile projects have an empowered team.
-This means that the team decides how to organize and how to accomplish its work.
-You can think of team as containing a distributed brain where each member continously helps make decisions.


BENEFITS OF AGILE PROJECTS:
-An agile approach to managing projects is often chosen because the results are often better than traditional approaches.
-This is especially true when the project invloves a lot of uncertainty.

For the customers:
>Desirable product
>High quality

-The customer is receiving a desirable product.
-This is because the customer consistently providess feedback in the development of the product.
-The team is always focused on delivering the highest priority features which means
customers are getting the most important features earlier than they would using traditional project management techniques.

-Agile teams are consistently matching what they build to what the customer is asking for.
-Agile projects also lead to higher quality.
-The assumption is that team members are knowledgeable and will build with high-quality at all times.
-Mistakes and unaticipated issues arise - in Agile projects, feedback loops are short and mistakes are expected to be fixed when they are discovered.


Benefits For the team:
>Higher job satisfaction
>Better innovation
>Lower costs
>Lower risk
>Predictable deliveries

-Agile teams often have higher job satisfaction.
This is due to the culture of empowering team members to define the best way to work together.
-Agile team embraces the learning process involved.

-Agile products have lower costs than traditional projects.
-This is because you are consistently receiving feedback and focusing on value.
-You are not performing wastful activities.
-Any problems found are resloved when they are discovered leading to lower re-work costs.

-the risk is lower because, you are getting continous feedback on what you are doing.
-Agile projects also result in predictable deliveries.
-Even if an Agile project has a strict deadline, the commitment can be made because you always have a shippable product.
-*What varies is the number of high value features that are in the product.
-this reduces the overall risk of the project.

Q) To ensure an agile project's delivery by a particular date, which one of these is usually not certain?
Ans) the number of features delivered

certain:
>The quality of the product
>The number of team members working on the project

Q) Agile projects uses ans) an experimental approach.

-We can use the scientific method not only for the discovery, but also to accomplish the work of a project.
>in addition to creating Hypothesis, 
we plan some work
then do the work 
we then learn from the feedback on the work and process.

Hypothesis > Experiment > Observe/ learn ..to Hypothesis

-This iterative learning loop of the scientific method is the foundation of many processes.
-The main idea is to continously learn and improve using iterations.

ex:
Plan > do > check > act / adjust (PDCA)
is a concept that improves buiness process

-plan > build > release involvoed in software development.

Spotify has same approach:
think > build > ship > tweak

>> AGILE vs WATERFALL

The traditional way to manage projects is also known as the waterfall approach.
-In waterfall approach, the entire product is developed in distinct phases.
        >Analyze
        >Design
        >Build
        >Test 
        >Release 

Analyze: Customer requirements are defined
         output is requirements document

Design: Features related to the requirments are designed.
        output: desing document

Build: using the desing document, features are then built.

Quality: Once product is build it moves to the testing phases

Release: Once the product passes the Quality Assurance, it moves for manufacturing or release.

>the difference is there is no looping in waterfall method.
>in this method, one team pass their work to another

Downsides of waterfall:
-you cannot predit the future
-High value features are not correclty identified
-Until the customer actually tries a feature, they do not really know if they will use it.
-you build unnecessary features (there is a waste)
-take longer to build them
-falls behind the schedule 
-market may change during the development
-change is hard and expensive
-outdated in many cases due to its setup cost 
>>When is waterfall used:


>In waterfall method you develop a product phase by phase
>In Agile, there are many small iterations where each phase are quickly
the end of each iterations results in a product increment.

Q) Agile development assumes all the team members are involved in project planning.

Jira:
Atlaasian Jira tool help work with Agile processes

Jira software is used to 
        manage, 
        develop and 
        communicated about work/projects

-Jira is easy to get started with,
-It can be used in a way that it matches your Agile processes.
-Jira can even be used if you follow waterfall approach to project management.

>Jira is organized around hierarchy.
-the highest level is what we call the "application level"
-A single Jira application can contain any number of projects.

Jira (Collection of Projects) - Application level
-project A (collection of issues) - project level 
-Issue  (Work item)  - issue level

>>Navigation in Jira:
you can see all you projects in: project menu
-to see all the works you done: your work
When yo click on specific projects you can see a side bar:
 -you can see the work items and their details by clicking on "issues"
 -the work items/issues helps to build features

- you can search for specific issue in search bar:
